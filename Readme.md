# ![icon](docs/img/icon.png) XCBuildAnalyzer

macOS app to inspect Xcode's build system graph

## Description

XCBuildAnalyzer is a standalone macOS app that renders the Xcode build system graph with some (limited) timing data. Analyzing the graph might be useful to understand dependencies between particular steps and why does build system invalidates previous build results. 

The tool relies on a build manifest json file that is always generated in the project DerivedData directory.

## Getting Started

[Inspecting Xcodeâ€™s build system graph at ease](https://medium.com/@londeix/inspecting-xcodes-build-system-graph-at-ease-e96573d5d340) blogpost on medium.com

To analyze your most recent build system graph, drag&drop a project file to the application area. Depending on a size of a project and nodes in a graph, it may take some time but usually should finish within couple of seconds.

On a left pane you will see graph nodes aggregated by target names (if applicable). The build graph is very often massive so to improve the reliability and performance, analyzing a subgraph is recommended.

Selecting a node will render a view with all input and output nodes in the center view.

If a node has some hidden input or outputs that were skipped for brevity, the node's icon â¤¡ or â¤¢ allow expanding them.

Selecting multiple nodes (using âŒ˜ or â‡§) in a left view draws the possible subgraph that includes all nodes.

On a right pane, you can inspect step details including input/output nodes, step tool, ENV variables etc.

If a build timing data was found along the build manifest, steps that were triggered in the most recent build have timing data. Look for ðŸ”¨ icons to found nodes that were recently executed.

#### Cycles

If a cycle has been found in the graph, affected nodes have a warning sign. Selecting them draws the full cycle (with some few side nodes):

#### Comparing build graphs between builds

By default, XCBuildAnalyzer finds the most recent graph manifest found in the DerivedData, but if you want to analyze or compare specific build graphs, you can drag&drop raw `manifest.json` files from `DerivedData/ProjectName/Build/Intermediates.noindex/XCBuildData/{build_hash}.xcbuilddata/manifest.json`. 

> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind for raw manifest mode, timing data is not available
